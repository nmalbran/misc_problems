Solutions to several algorithms problems.

## Spiral Matrix Print

Problem: Given a squared matrix, print it in a spiral form.

    Given:
    M = A B C
        D E F
        G H I
    Return:
    > A D G H I F C B E


Bonus: The same, but the matrix is in a list.

    Given:
    M = A B C D E F G H I
    Return:
    > A D G H I F C B E
